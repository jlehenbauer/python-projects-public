After years of practicing psychology you decided that it's time to find the answer to the following very important question: how can different species live together in harmony? In order to answer this question, you headed out for a long journey. After several years of wandering, you finally found what you were looking for: a village where humans, cats and dogs lived in the perfect harmony.

Trying to understand the source of this harmony, you are gathering information about all members of the village community. You're currently working on determining the age of each member converted to human age. Here's how cats and dogs age can be converted:

The first and the second years of a cat's life are roughly equal to 12.5 years of a human's, and after this, each additional year is around four 'human years'.
The first year of a dog's life is equal to 15 years of a human's life, the second dog's year is equal to another 9 years of a human's life, and after this, each additional year is around four 'human years'.
Given information about the members of the village community, return information about their ages converted to human age.

Example

For members = [["cat", "2"], ["dog", "2"], ["human", "2"]],
the output should be

toHumanAge(members) = ["25 y.o. in human age",
                       "24 y.o. in human age",
                       "2 y.o. in human age"]
